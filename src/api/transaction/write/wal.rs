//! Write-Ahead Log (WAL) integration for transactions.
//!
//! This module bridges the high-level `WriteTransaction` system with the low-level
//! `ConcurrentWalSystem`. It ensures durability by logging all buffered operations
//! to the WAL before they are applied to the in-memory storage.
//!
//! # Architecture
//!
//! The transaction commit process follows a "Log-Before-Apply" protocol:
//! 1.  Validate buffered writes.
//! 2.  **Log operations to WAL** (this module).
//! 3.  Wait for durability (fsync), depending on `DurabilityMode`.
//! 4.  Apply changes to `CurrentStorage`.
//!
//! This ensures that if the system crashes after step 2/3 but before step 4,
//! the changes can be recovered from the WAL on restart.
//!
//! # Performance
//!
//! The conversion from `BufferedWrite` (transaction buffer) to `WalOperation` (WAL entry)
//! is designed to be zero-allocation for string data. It leverages `InternedString`
//! IDs (4-byte integers) instead of copying full strings, making the logging process
//! extremely fast.

/// Log all buffered operations to the Write-Ahead Log (WAL).
///
/// This function translates the transaction's buffered writes into WAL operations
/// and appends them to the concurrent WAL system.
///
/// # Durability & Recovery
///
/// This is the critical step for ACID durability. Once this function returns and
/// the WAL flush completes, the transaction is considered durable. If the system
/// crashes, recovery logic will replay these operations to restore the state.
///
/// # Zero-Copy Optimization
///
/// This function performs a "shallow copy" of the data. Instead of serializing
/// full string labels and keys, it copies their 4-byte `InternedString` IDs.
/// This minimizes memory allocation and bus traffic during the critical commit path.
///
/// # Transaction framing (Issue #3413)
///
/// The buffered data ops are bracketed by a leading [`WalOperation::BeginTx`]
/// and a terminal [`WalOperation::CommitTx`] carrying the real
/// `commit_timestamp` and the data-op count, and the whole
/// `[BeginTx, ..data.., CommitTx]` sequence is appended in the SAME atomic
/// `append_batch_async` allocation (one LSN band, one flush epoch). This lets
/// crash recovery (a) discard a batch whose commit marker never became durable
/// — instead of replaying a torn prefix as a half-committed transaction — and
/// (b) re-stamp every recovered version of the transaction with the single
/// `commit_timestamp` instead of each entry's own wallclock (which previously
/// let `AS OF SYSTEM_TIME` bisect an atomic batch).
///
/// The markers ride entirely inside the existing `wal` critical section, so the
/// CLAUDE.md lock order (current_timestamp → wal → …) is unchanged.
///
/// # Arguments
///
/// * `tx` - The active write transaction containing the write buffer.
/// * `commit_timestamp` - The authoritative bi-temporal commit timestamp, carried
///   in the terminal `CommitTx` marker and re-stamped onto every replayed version.
///
/// # Returns
///
/// `(base_lsn, wait_epoch)`:
/// - `base_lsn` — the lowest LSN allocated for this transaction (the
///   `BeginTx` marker's LSN) — for a non-empty transaction, or `None` for an
///   empty transaction (no ops appended). The base LSN is registered as the
///   commit's in-flight watermark by the caller (lost-write persist race fix).
/// - `wait_epoch` — the group-commit epoch to wait on (`None` for modes
///   without epoch tracking). For an empty transaction this is still the
///   result of `commit()` (the durability mode's commit step runs even with
///   no frame).
///
/// # Membership atomicity (Issue #3805)
///
/// The non-empty path appends and registers via
/// [`ConcurrentWalSystem::append_batch_and_commit`], which holds the
/// membership lock across the append→register pair. The empty path calls
/// `commit()` directly (nothing was appended, so there is no window).
///
/// # Errors
///
/// Returns an error if the WAL append fails (e.g., disk full, IO error).
