//! # Thread Safety
//!
//! - Multiple threads can call `append*` methods concurrently
//! - Writers are assigned to stripes via thread-local affinity
//! - The flush coordinator drains all stripes and writes to disk
//!
//! # Performance
//!
//! - **Append latency**: ~50-100ns (lock-free)
//! - **Throughput**: 500K+ entries/sec with 16+ stripes
//! - **Scalability**: Linear up to 64 concurrent writers
//!
//! # Buffer Exhaustion / Backpressure
//!
//! When all stripes fill up faster than the flush coordinator can drain them:
//!
//! 1. **Non-blocking append (`try_append`)**: Returns `Err(entry)` immediately
//!    after exponential spin backoff. The caller can retry, drop, or queue the
//!    entry externally.
//!
//! 2. **Blocking append (`append_blocking`)**: Spins briefly, then sleeps with
//!    exponential backoff (1µs → 2µs → 4µs → ... → 1ms) until space is available.
//!    This provides automatic backpressure but may block the calling thread.
//!
//! 3. **Async append (`append_async`)**: Uses `append_blocking` internally, so
//!    it will block until space is available. This is intentional - async here
//!    means "no durability wait", not "non-blocking".
//!
//! **Sizing guidance**: With default settings (16 stripes × 1024 capacity), the
//! WAL can buffer 16,384 entries. At 500K entries/sec with 10ms flush interval,
//! ~5,000 entries accumulate per interval. The default sizing provides ~3x
//! headroom for burst traffic.
//!
//! **Monitoring**: Use `stripe_metrics()` to detect high buffer utilization.
//! If `entries_pending` consistently exceeds 50% of capacity, consider:
//! - Increasing `stripe_capacity`
//! - Increasing `num_stripes`
//! - Reducing flush interval
