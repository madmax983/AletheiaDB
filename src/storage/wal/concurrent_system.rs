//! Unified Concurrent WAL System.
//!
//! This module provides [`ConcurrentWalSystem`], which combines the concurrent
//! WAL striped architecture with the flush coordinator into a single, cohesive
//! component that can be used as a drop-in replacement for the old `WriteAheadLog`.
//!
//! # Architecture

    ///    advances `flushed_epoch` only over the contiguous run starting at
    ///    `flushed_epoch + 1`. Finishing 6 before 5 therefore parks 6 in the
    ///    set until 5 lands, at which point both are released in one sweep.
    /// 2. **An error is recorded against ITS OWN epoch.** `finish_flush`
    ///    pushes `(epoch, message)` onto `recent_errors`, and `wait_for_flush`
    ///    scans that list for its own epoch number. Arrival order does not
    ///    enter into either side, so deferring delivery never misattributes an
    ///    outcome to a different epoch than the one it came from.
    ///
    /// SCOPE OF THAT GUARANTEE — it is about *epoch* attribution, not about
    /// which transactions an epoch's entries belong to. A transaction is a
    /// member of the epoch it REGISTERS into, and the membership lock (Issue
    /// #3805) is what keeps that aligned with flush membership: the
    /// write-transaction path holds it across append→register
    /// (`append_batch_and_commit`), and the flusher holds it across
    /// drain→`start_flush` (`drain_and_open_epoch`), so a cycle can no longer
    /// land inside the append→register window and drain a frame into epoch
    /// `X` while its transaction registers into `X + 1`. See
